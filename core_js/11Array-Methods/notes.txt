Notes:
array:most of array method contain callbavk fun

1.map function
//map function will not change original array
//it will add/remove or check some condition and it will return new set of data.
//it consists of two parameter (i)each iteration value (ii)index value.
================================================
2.filter function:
//it will not change the original array 
//It is used to filter the data depends upon the condition.
//Once condition is met it will return the following value into the new array.
//filter consists of callback function.
==========================================
3.find function:
//it will not change the original array.
//It is used to find one particular data. IF matches found it will stop searching further
//if not find particular data then it shows undefine
//it also consists of index parameter as well.
========================================
diffrenc between find and find index filter 
//find will return single value 
//findindex will return index
//filter combination of data will return array
=====================================
if we find greater value or condition value then use reduce function and add conditional oprater
//return will be result a,b a will be result and b will be new value
4.reduce function: 
index is not there
//it will not change the original array. 
//it used to reduce the value into single parameter 
//it consists of two parameter one is return result or accumulator and next one is iteraion value and third parameter will be index if needed.
=======================================
5.findIndex  -- once match found it will return the index value it will from position 0.if it is not found then will return -1
6.findLast  - it will find the last vale once match is found it will start from position last.
it will start searching from last
7.findLastIndex - it will find the last occurence of that particular value in the given array. 
=============================================
8.some - any one value is met the condition it will return the boolean value true otherwise false.
means in array is any number is greater than 18 it will return true
9.every - if all the value is met the condition then only it will return true otherwise false.
==========================================
polyfil is that browser compatbility for latest version in the browser
================================
fill: it will change the original value and similar to slice method and it replae the value
there two paramete index and length whatever you want to add example fill('world,5,7)
================
copywithin: it will copy the index and refilling but in fill it will give own value
