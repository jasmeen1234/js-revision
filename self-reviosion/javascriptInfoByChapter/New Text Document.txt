//Variable
let message; //declaration
we can write in one line like declaration and assignment both
let message = 'Hello!';
We can also declare multiple variables in one line:

let user = 'John', age = 25, message = 'Hello';


let user = 'John';       2)let user = 'John',   3)let user = 'John'
let age = 25;            age = 25,             , age = 25
let message = 'Hello';   message = 'Hello';      , message = 'Hello';
all these are same type work
